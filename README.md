# Pitch Analyzer

This project analyzes pitch data for male, female, and combined groups using **Python**. It processes pitch datasets to compute averages and other relevant statistics for each group separately and combined.

---

## 🔬 Features

- **Separate analysis scripts** for male, female, and combined datasets.
- **Simple command-line execution**.
- **Clean and modular code** for easy updates or dataset changes.
- **Output results** directly printed or saved (depending on the script design).

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- (Optional) Pandas / NumPy if extended for CSV or large data processing

---

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

Clone or download this repository, then run:

```bash
python MaleAverage.py
python FemaleAverage.py
python CombinedAverage.py
```

Make sure all data files (if needed) are in the same directory as the scripts.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
MaleAverage.py       → Analyzes pitch data for male subjects
FemaleAverage.py     → Analyzes pitch data for female subjects
CombinedAverage.py   → Analyzes pitch data combining both groups
```

## 📊 Data Analysis

Each script computes:

- **Average pitch** for the group
- (Optional) Other statistical insights if implemented
